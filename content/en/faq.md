## The model

#### Is there a general description available for the 3 maturity levels?
1. The first maturity level aims at achieving an ad-hoc, best effort implementation of a particular activity within a stream.
2. The second maturity level aims to establish a consistent, repeatable process that can be relied on.
3. The third maturity level aims to maximize effectiveness through continuous improvement, based on effective and timely feedback.

This content is part of our {{< external-link "https://github.com/owaspsamm/core/tree/develop/model" "data files on GitHub">}}. We'll work on having it available on the website soon.

#### Can you explain streams in the SAMM model?
Streams cover different aspects of a practice inside a business function. For example, in the Requirements-driven testing practice, the streams focus on positive and negative testing.
See [Requirements-driven Testing](https://owaspsamm.org/model/verification/requirements-driven-testing/) in the model.  
Check out our [about page](/about) for more on the structure of the SAMM model.

#### When was SAMM v2 released?

We released SAMM version 2 on the 31st of January 2020, check out our [release blog](https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/01/31/samm2-release/) (Huray!).

## Assessment

#### Do I need a 1 out of 1 rating for maturity level 1 before working on level 2?

It is not strictly required to get a 1 out 1 rating on maturity level 1 to start working on maturity level 2. <br>
There might be activities of maturity level 1 that are not relevant for you which you can bypass, moving to maturity level 2 activities.

We did order the activities in a logical order and maturity levels, but each organization and team can have unique situations, where some of them are not relevant or could be implemented in a different order.

#### Do I run the full SAMM assessment questionnaire with every stakeholder and team member or do I pick relevant people for each question?

If you have to send the questionnaire for people to fill out on their own, you can send the full questionnaire and ask them to fill out anything they feel fairly confident on the answers. If you are running sessions where you are asking them questions, then maybe don't go down the list. Just keep in mind what needs to be answered and interact with them as a conversation. Have them explain how things work and what doesn't. Then translate the notes to answers to the questions in the questionnaire.

## Community

#### Is there a list of SAMM practitioners?
We've put together a [list of practitioners](/practitioners). It's not comprehensive but we hope it's helpful.

#### How can I contribute to SAMM?
We regularly get asked, how can we contribute to SAMM?<br>

#### Is there a process for translation efforts of SAMM into other languages?
Yes! We're using {{< external-link "https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-samm" "CrowdIn">}} and the help of the community to have SAMM translated to other languages.

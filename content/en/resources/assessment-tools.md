## Links to info and tools

If you want to learn more about SAMM assessments, we have a couple of dedicated pages for that. First, there's the [assessment](/assessment) page. We also have an [assessment guide](/assessment-guide), with lots of practical advice, best practices, and an {{< external-link " https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUsktgsGna65KJPCT91UiOxFRvKdFs0TJxCWN0aa5u4/edit?usp=sharing" "example set of questions">}} for an interview-style assessment. If you're just looking for the links to our spreadsheets or online assessment, here they are.

### Spreadsheets

We have 2 versions of the SAMM Toolbox, a {{< external-link "https://github.com/owaspsamm/core/releases/latest" "Microsoft Excel Toolbox">}} and a {{< external-link "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jmLVltRhuG19AX5cLUcWH1Qox2Uic17rD29gMVG5zDE/view#gid=1716553355" "Google Spreadsheet Toolbox">}}.

### Online assessment

SAMMwise allows you to self-host an online assessment tool. You can find its GitHub repository and documentation {{< external-link "https://github.com/owaspsamm/sammwise" "here">}}.

{{< external-link "https://sammy.codific.com/" "SAMMY">}} is a third-party tool by Codific, one of our sponsors, that allows you to do online SAMM assessments, too!

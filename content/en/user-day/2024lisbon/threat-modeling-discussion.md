    Threat Modeling interacts with many other activities during a secure development lifecycle. For example, it can be a way to enforce security requirements or perform architecture assessment. Its versatility leads to many different implementations and approaches. Letâ€™s discuss what managed to provide value in the real world, and what might have failed to.

    This session is made to be a reverse panel discussion, where the audience is encouraged to bring their own stories and share them with the room. Host will provide structure and stories of his own.

    Software security is an essential concern worldwide and as the saying goes: you don't manage what you can't measure. Measurability stands as one of the foundational principles of OWASP SAMM. SAMM is open source framework that is technology, process and organization agnostic. These fundamental qualities have convinced us to implement SAMM across our entire organization. Despite encountering a few challenges along the way, SAMM has proven its worth by delivering on its promises. It has become a cornerstone of our security assurance programme.In this presentation, we are excited to share our experiences and the valuable lessons we've gained from implementing SAMM.

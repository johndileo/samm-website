abstract: |
    Threat modeling is a process and leveraging a risk centric approach using PASTA, OpenSAMM provides a great way to measure how we can measure the journey of a PASTA threat modeling roll out using one of OWASP's iconic maturity models for AppSec.  PASTA has a built in RACI and associated activities per each of its seven stages and in this talk, we'll map to the OWASP SAMM model to see how maturity can be measured over time against the activities for each stage of the Process for Attack Simulation & Threat Analysis.

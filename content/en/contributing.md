### Users and practitioners

We have created a [Users](/samm-users) page to share organizations that have adopted SAMM and a [Practitioners](/practitioners) page to list companies providing SAMM services.

[Contact us](/contact) if you want to be listed so we can all get an idea of who is using SAMM and how that’s working for them.

### GitHub issues

All of SAMM’s content is on {{< external-link "https://github.com/owaspsamm/" "Github">}}. 


We use 
- YAML files for the data that makes up the model - {{< external-link "https://github.com/owaspsamm/core" "core repository">}}
- Hugo for the website - {{< external-link "https://github.com/owaspsamm/website" "website repository">}}

#### Familiar with GitHub?
To make changes to either, follow these steps:

1. Create a branch from one of our repositories
2. Make changes and push the branch to GitHub
3. Create a pull request and add someone in the SAMM core team as a reviewer

Once the changes are approved, someone from the team will merge that branch to the main branch of the corresponding repository.

#### Not familiar with GitHub?
GitHub is a company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git.  
If you've never used Git or GitHub you can always use the regular channels for feedback.

Read our [blog post](/blog/2020/03/31/samm-is-doing-cicd/) on how SAMM is doing CI/CD.

#### What is Hugo?
Hugo is a static site generator written in Go, a statically typed, compiled programming language. It integrates well with GitHub and allows us to automatically build the site every time we make changes.

### Translations


We've started using Crowdin for localization management. We want to have the SAMM model available in as many languages as possible.  
Visit our {{< external-link "https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-samm" "project page">}} on Crowdin to start contributing.

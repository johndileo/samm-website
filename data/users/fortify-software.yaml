testimonial: "These days people understand that security has to be built in–it can’t be bolted on. But for many a big question remains: what does it take to build secure software? SAMM tackles that question head on with a framework for creating and growing a software security initiative. SAMM has focused the way I think about the human side of the software security problem."
